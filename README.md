# About this project

This is a small booking seats ðŸ’º app I created to practise react a bit more. It does not have full functionality, just the interface and simple booking interactions. It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to run

``` 
    git clone https://github.com/celiagomezdev/book-seats-app.git
    cd book-seats-app
    npm install 
    npm start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
